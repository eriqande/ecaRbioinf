This is an R package for performing small bioinformatic tasks that I am
likely going to have to do more than once.  In some cases there are probably
Unix tools that do these things, but I couldn't find them, and, in some cases,
I was surprised at how quickly and efficiently R could handle some things.

You can install it like this:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")  #  <-- Do this if you don't have the 'remotes' package
remotes::install_github("eriqande/ecaRbioinf")
```

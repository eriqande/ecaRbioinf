This is an R package for performing small bioinformatic tasks that I am
likely going to have to do more than once. In some cases there are
probably Unix tools that do these things, but I couldn’t find them, and,
in some cases, I was surprised at how quickly and efficiently R could
handle some things.

There are also likely BioConductor solutions for many of these.

You can install it like this:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")  #  <-- Do this if you don't have the 'remotes' package
remotes::install_github("eriqande/ecaRbioinf")
```

Sorry! No vignettes, but at least the help files are somewhat put
together.
